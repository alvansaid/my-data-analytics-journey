# My Data Analytics Journey

Welcome to my data analytics journey!
Here are all my journey story on data analytics projects that all I have been finished. These projects are including descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics, enjoy the journey!

1. **Machine learning classification method to classify Stroke dataset prediction using Linear Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression methods.**
- _link to repository_: [LSVM and Logistic Regression for Stroke Dataset](https://github.com/alvansaid/lsvm-logreg-stroke)
- _description_: Classifying **stroke dataset** from CT scan data using **machine learning classification model**, especially **linear models** including **support vector machine** and **logistic regression**. This techniques are yielded **beyond 95% accuracy**, **recall**, and **f1 scores**, which telling us that the data already a good and clean to be inputted into machine learning models.
- _about_: Balance classficiation for disease detection, using machine learning classification models, comparison between linear kernel support vector machine and logistic regression as linear classification models, beyond 90% accuracy, recall, and f1 score metrics.

2. **Campus Recruitment Data Analysis from Student Background.**

- _link to repository_: [Campus Recruitment Data Analysis](https://github.com/alvansaid/data_mining_eda_campus_recruitment_kaggle)
- _description_: Analyzing **student background dataset** from kaggle data using **exploratory data analysis**, **data visualization**, and **machine learning classification model**, and gain insights from that analysis process. The models are yielded **beyond 85% accuracy**, and we got the **correllated variables from the models** including results from 10th grade, work experience, and etc.
- _about_: Exploratory data analysis, data visualization of student background and correllation between successful campus accceptance and student background variables, using machine learning classification models, beyond 85% accuracy metric.
