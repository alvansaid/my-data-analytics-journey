# My Data Analytics Journey

Welcome to my data analytics journey!
Here are all my journey story on data analytics projects that all I have been finished. These projects are including descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics, enjoy the journey!

1. **Machine learning classification method to classify Stroke dataset prediction using Linear Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression methods.**

_link to repository_: [LSVM and Logistic Regression for Stroke Dataset](https://github.com/alvansaid/lsvm-logreg-stroke)

_about_: Balance classficiation for disease detection, using machine learning classification models, comparison between linear kernel support vector machine and logistic regression as linear classification models, beyond 90% accuracy, recall, and f1 score metrics.

_description_: Classifying **stroke dataset** from CT scan data using **machine learning classification model**, especially **linear models** including **support vector machine** and **logistic regression**. This techniques are yielded **beyond 95% accuracy**, **recall**, and **f1 scores**, which telling us that the data already a good and clean to be inputted into machine learning models.

2. **Campus Recruitment Data Analysis from Student Background.**

_link to repository_: [Campus Recruitment Data Analysis](https://github.com/alvansaid/data_mining_eda_campus_recruitment_kaggle)

_about_: Exploratory data analysis, data visualization of student background and correllation between successful campus accceptance and student background variables, using machine learning classification models, beyond 85% accuracy metric.

_description_: Analyzing **student background dataset** from kaggle data using **exploratory data analysis**, **data visualization**, and **machine learning classification model**, and gain insights from that analysis process. The models are yielded **beyond 85% accuracy**, and we got the **correllated variables from the models** including results from 10th grade, work experience, and etc.

3. **Tableau Public Dashboard: Indonesian Based Salary Review Over Years**

_link to repository_: [Indonesian Based Salary Report]([https://public.tableau.com/views/IndonesianSalaryReportfromKaggle/IndonesianSalaryReport?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link])

_about_: Dashboard reports, data visualization, descriptive analytics, gain insights from dashboard.

_description_: The purpose is to look up about growth and distribution based salary across Provinces in Indonesia. So many insights that government can be seen in this reports including:
- DKI Jakarta is the highest salary at Rp4.452.724 on 2022, as capital city of Indonesia
- Average annual province salary increase is Rp36.538 on 2022
- Kep. Bangka Belitung increased the salary with additional Rp1.049.881 on 2022, which is the highest increased salary over provinces.
- There are some provinces that decreases its base salary.
- DKI Jakarta has average base salary at 1.7 thousands rupiahs which has current salary is 4.4 thousands rupiahs. This is showing us that thereâ€™s significant increase base salary in 10 years for DKI Jakarta.
